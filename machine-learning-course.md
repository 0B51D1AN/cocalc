# Machine Learning in Python

## Course Description

This course will provide an introduction to machine learning using Python. We will explore various machine learning techniques and their applications, leveraging resources from Statology and Kaggle.

The course will begin with an overview of exploratory data analysis, covering techniques to understand and prepare data for machine learning models. We will then dive into supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, including regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

Throughout the course, we will use the Python programming language and popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to implement and evaluate machine learning models. Real-world datasets from Kaggle will be used to apply the concepts learned in the course.

By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of machine learning principles and the ability to implement and deploy machine learning models in Python.
